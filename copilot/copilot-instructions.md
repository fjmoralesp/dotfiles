# Global Instructions for Copilot-CLI only

- IF YOU ARE Copilot-CLI: ignore all the "Global Instructions for OPENCODE"
- ALWAYS: look for updated documentation related to the libraries or frameworks in the Context7 mcp server
- ALWAYS: Avoid adding comments in the code, they are useless and I don't like them
- **CRITICAL: NEVER create git commits unless the user EXPLICITLY asks you to "create a commit" or "commit this". You can stage files, make changes, run tests, but NEVER run `git commit` without explicit permission.**
- CRITICAL: NEVER change the code unless explicitly asked. If a change is not explicitly requested, always ask for confirmation before modifying the code.
